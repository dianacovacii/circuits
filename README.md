# Digital Logic Circuits 

A collection of fundamental computer architecture components built in Logisim for COMP 273: Introduction to Computer Systems at McGill University. 

* Designed and implemented a 4-bit ALU with comprehensive status reporting
* Built a memory unit with address decoding, read/write control, and data registers 
* Gained practical experience with digital logic simulation and state management

## Projects

### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
* Input: Two 4-bit operands
* Output: 4-bit result
* Status Register: 3-bit (overflow, zero, negative)
* Operations: Addition and Subtraction
* File: `ALU/ALU.circ`

### Random Access Memory (RAM)
* Capacity: 8 registers x 4-bit words
* Addressing: 3-bit address registers
* Control: 1-bit mode register (Read/Write)
* Data Interface: 4-bit input register, 4-bit output register
* File: `RAM/RAM.circ`

## Usage
1. Download and install [Logisim](https://www.cburch.com/logisim/)

2. Open the .circ file for the ALU or RAM

3. Use input pins and clocks to simulate and test behavior
